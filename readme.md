#### How to run the services

Make sure you're using windows or mac which have docker daemon that facilitates the `host.docker.internal` otherwise kindly do the necessary adjustment.

Do `cp .env.example .env`
Now Run `docker compose up --build` and your service will be up and running...

The default port is set to be 3000, there you will have the `Browsable API` interface for navigating effectively.

Due to shortage of RAM(400mb azure vps) couldnt actually run it.
